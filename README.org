* Testing and Delivery of the Base Container Images

This repository contains the slides for the presentation "Testing and Delivery
of the Base Container Images" held at the openSUSE Conference 2023.

You can find the rendered slides here: [[https://dcermak.github.io/testing_and_delivery_bci/testing_and_delivery_bci.html][dcermak.github.io/testing_and_delivery_bci]].


** Building the slides

You can create the html slides yourself from within Emacs by opening the
[[./testing_and_delivery_bci.org]] file, launching =org-mode= and executing ~(require
'ox-reveal)~ (you might have to install =ox-reveal= beforehand). Then export the
org file to reveal.js (this is by default bound to the keychord =C-c C-e R R=).

If you are not a Emacs user, then just install Emacs and execute:
#+begin_src bash
emacs testing_and_delivery_bci.org -Q --batch -l export-init.el -f org-reveal-export-to-html --kill
#+end_src
